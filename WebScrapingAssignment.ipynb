    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. It involves fetching data from web pages, parsing the HTML content, and extracting the desired information. Web scraping is used to gather data from websites where no official API is available, or when manual data collection is not feasible. Three areas where web scraping is commonly used include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Aggregation and Market Research: Gathering product prices, reviews, and other relevant data from e-commerce websites for competitive analysis and market research.\n",
    "News and Content Aggregation: Collecting headlines, articles, and other news content from various news websites for creating aggregated news feeds.\n",
    "Business and Lead Generation: Extracting contact information, company details, and other relevant data from business directories for lead generation and contact lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing HTML Directly: Using libraries like requests to fetch HTML content from a website, and then parsing the HTML using regular expressions or string manipulation.\n",
    "Using Web Scraping Libraries: Utilizing specialized web scraping libraries like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, or Selenium, which provide more structured and efficient ways to parse and extract data from HTML.\n",
    "Headless Browsers: Using headless browser automation tools like Selenium to simulate user interactions with the website and extract data.\n",
    "API Scraping: Some websites provide APIs that allow you to fetch data directly in a structured format, bypassing the need for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides a convenient way to navigate and search through the parsed HTML tree, extract specific elements, attributes, and text content. Beautiful Soup is widely used in web scraping projects to efficiently extract data from web pages by simplifying the process of locating and extracting information from the HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is commonly used to build web applications. In the context of a web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a simple web application that displays the scraped data in a user-friendly manner. For example, you could use Flask to build a dashboard where users can enter a URL, initiate the web scraping process, and then view the extracted data on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service:\n",
    "In a web scraping project hosted on AWS, you might use the following AWS services:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): EC2 is used to provision virtual servers (instances) in the cloud. You could deploy your Flask web application and web scraping code on an EC2 instance, making it accessible over the internet.\n",
    "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): S3 is a storage service used to store and retrieve data, such as scraped content, images, or other files. You can store the scraped data in S3 buckets for easy access and durability.\n",
    "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): RDS is a managed database service that you could use to store structured data obtained from web scraping. It provides a scalable and reliable database solution for your application.\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch: CloudWatch is used for monitoring and logging AWS resources. You can set up CloudWatch alarms to track the health and performance of your EC2 instance and other resources.\n",
    "Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): VPC allows you to create a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch your resources. It provides network security and control over your AWS environment.\n",
    "These AWS services would help you deploy, store, and manage your web scraping project in a scalable and reliable manner.\n",
