    "\n",
    " Multiprocessing in Python refers to the use of multiple processes to achieve parallelism and concurrency in a program. It allows a Python program to utilize multiple CPU cores or processors to execute tasks simultaneously. Each process runs independently, has its memory space, and can perform its calculations without interfering with other processes. \n",
