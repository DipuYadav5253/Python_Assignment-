    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self keyword is used as a convention to refer to the instance (object) of a class within the class methods. It acts as a reference to the current object on which the method is being called.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Attribute Access: By using self, methods can access the object's attributes and perform operations on them. It allows for the encapsulation of data within an object and enables the object to maintain its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Method Invocation: Using self, methods can call other methods of the same object. It provides a way to invoke other behaviors and functionalities within the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Differentiating Local Variables: By using self, you can distinguish between local variables and instance variables within the class methods. It helps to avoid confusion and ensures that the intended object's attributes are accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Inheritance and Polymorphism: The use of self facilitates the inheritance mechanism, allowing derived classes to override or extend the behavior of base class methods while maintaining access to the inherited attributes and methods through the self reference."
